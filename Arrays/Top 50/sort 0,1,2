The three-pointers will be: current, zeroPos and twoPos.:
current - This will hold the position of the current element that weâ€™re on during the iteration of the array. This will be initialised to 0.
zeroPos - This will hold the index where we will push any 0s that we may encounter. This will be initialised to 0.
twoPos - This will hold the index where we will push any 2s that we may encounter. This will be initialised to n - 1, where n is the size of the array.

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
void sort012(int *arr, int n)
{
    int curr=0;
    int poszero=0;
    int postwo=n-1;
    
    while(curr<=postwo)
    {
        if(arr[curr] == 0)
        {
            swap(arr[curr++],arr[poszero++]);
        }
        else if(arr[curr] == 2)
        {
            swap(arr[curr],arr[postwo--]);
        }
        else
            curr++;
    }
