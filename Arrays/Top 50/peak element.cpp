****BRUTE FORCE****
Time Complexity
O(n), Where ‘n’ denotes the number of elements present in the sequence.

 

We need to traverse the array once to find the peak element hence the time complexity is of the order of ‘n’.

Space Complexity
O(1). We are using constant space

******OPTIMAL*****
Time Complexity
O(log(n)), ‘n’ is the length of the array.

 

The binary search takes time of the order of log (n)
